# Workshop: SARS-CoV-2 incidence estimation

We will do genome-based incidence estimation using a small example SARS-CoV-2 genome set first.

See also the corresponding [Publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26267-y).

For the hands-on, please [go to the Demo section in the GInPipe repository](https://github.com/KleistLab/GInPipe#demo).

A larger example data set is provided in the [OSF](https://osf.io/hxk5m). After the small example, download also this data set and perform genomic incidence estimation.
